In this project, we used an M5Stack Core 2 development board along with FastLED to control the lighting in our home. The project focuses on three rooms within the house, each of them can be controlled through our system. We offer a range of options to choose from, including selecting a specific color, activating party mode for a lively atmosphere, enabling blinking effects, and turning off the lights when desired. This project allows for flexible and convenient control over the lighting in our home.
